# Optimality-Theory-Phonology
This is code I did for class to run through a dictionary and pull specific information about the entries

hw7 - finding the type counts and probabilities of those type counts, weighted OT (the categories and weights were determined by me), also finding the syllable lengths for nouns and vowels
hw8 - finding single syllable words and creating a statistical phonological model, similar to hw7
